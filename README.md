# Codebreaker - A kid-friendly web app

## Creating secret messages using symbols [Live Demo](https://codebreaker.drork.live)

A kid-friendly web app using Livewire, Laravel, and Tailwind that allows us to type a message and instantly generate the corresponding symbols.

"code-breaking" worksheets where each letter in a secret message is represented as a symbol. They then refer to an alphabet lookup table, and perform the translation.
